I developed a temperature converter website to showcase my frontend skills. The user-friendly interface allows seamless conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin, providing a practical tool for quick temperature calculations. The website features a clean design and responsive layout with the use of HTML , CSS and JS .
